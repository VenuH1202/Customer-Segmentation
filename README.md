# Customer-Segmentation
It is an Unsupervised Learning model built in Python. PCA is used to reduce the number of dimensions, then customers are grouped into clusters based on their similarities using K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering. Clusters are evaluated by checking their behavioral pattern with respect to every feature through visualizations.
